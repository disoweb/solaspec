Store Support Options
Vendors can provide store support to customers, either through an external 
platform, via email, or through the built-in messaging tool. Verified customers
 can request support on order and store pages.


Messaging Module – Admin & Shop Communication
MarketKing’s messaging module not only connects vendors and customers across 
various features, but also allows easy communication between vendor and market 
admins. Both vendors and admins can initiate conversations, discussing orders, 
products, payouts, marketplace rules, etc.


Vendor Invoices, Packing Slips, Shipping Labels
Through the invoicing & packing module, each vendor can configure their own 
invoice settings. PDF invoices are auto generated for each order and suborder 
and can be downloaded by vendors via the order page. Vendors can add their 
store name, address, logo, as well as any custom info such as VAT or company
 data. Similarly, shipping labels, packing slips and more can be generated.


Shipping Tracking (New!)
The shipping tracking module allows vendors to enter tracking details for 
their shipments. Customers are notified and can easily track their packages. 
Supports DHL, TNT, Fedex, UPS, DPD, USPS, Royal Mail and more, and vendors 
can also enter details for custom providers.


Zone-Wise Shipping
Through the advanced shipping module, each vendor can configure their own 
shipping settings by zone. Vendors can use shipping classes, and the market 
admin can also force enable specific methods for all vendors.


MarketKing Cart – Cart Split by Vendor
MarketKing has its own proprietary split cart system that separates products by vendor in the cart.

Modern display style with highest conversion rates.
Fees, discounts, taxes, etc are all split and displayed by vendor.
Classic cart can also be enabled through settings.
Same cart system used by large marketplaces such as Etsy.


Order Splitter for Multi Vendor Orders
Customers can order from multiple vendors at the same time, and MarketKing 
will automatically split these orders into multiple sub-orders.

Each vendor has access to only their own specific sub-orders.
Customers pay for the combined order but can see the status of each individual 
sub-order.
Parent orders are excluded from analytics and reports so that reports and 
statistics are always accurate.
Fees, discounts, or coupons either go to their respective orders / products, 
or are proportionally split between orders.
